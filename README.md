# CFM
 A centralised franchise management (CFM) system is a platform that streamlines and simplifies the act of setting up new franchises and managing existing ones, it provides tools to both the individual franchise owners as well as the overall business owners by integrating all relevant information in one place. It is designed to be able to help the business owners keep track of and compare performances of individual franchises with financial monitoring, and also allows them to better manage inventory in each of their franchises optimising delivery scheduling which in turn leads to less wastages which directly results in a decrease in operational costs.
The features of the CFM can broadly be categorised into 2 groups (or views) that cater to the needs of the business owner and the franchise owner respectively.
The first view consists of information about individual franchises such as profit margins, revenue streams, staff sizes and raw material stocks. It is also designed to show the owners the orders placed by the respective franchises for raw materials thereby allowing the business owner to better keep track of their status, the system also provides statistical tools for the business owner to compare the performances of their franchises.
The second view is the franchise view that allows the individual franchise owners to better run their franchises by simplifying and streamlining their data. It allows them to monitor their orders, track the staff and allow them to take stock of their inventory to optimise the way they conduct business.
